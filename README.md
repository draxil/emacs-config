Modular emacs configuration!

This is my emacs configuration, which is designed to live as a .emacs.d directory. The useful/stealable snippets are under "modules/". The "init.el" file runs everything else. The structure was <s>ripped off from</s>/inspired by these posts:

Whilst many of the actual useful things in my configuration come from:
